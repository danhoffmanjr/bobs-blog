                <h1>Bender, you risked your life to save me!</h1>
                <p>Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute.</p>
                <p>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Stop it, stop it. It's fine. I will 'destroy' you! <strong> Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?</strong> <em> Check it out, y'all.</em> Everyone who was invited is here.</p>
                <h2>Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.</h2>
                <p>You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie! You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! And until then, I can never die? No, she'll probably make me do it.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Oh Leela! You're the only person I could turn to; you're the only person who ever loved me.</li><li>Moving along…</li><li>No! The cat shelter's on to me.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.</h3>
                <p>You're going back for the Countess, aren't you? Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Meh. And then the battle's not so bad?</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music.</li><li>Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.</li><li>Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Why yes! Thanks for noticing. The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men.</p>
                <p>Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon. We'll need to have a look inside you with this camera. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!</p>
                <p>When I was first asked to make a film about my nephew, Hubert Farnsworth, I thought "Why should I?" Then later, Leela made the film. But if I did make it, you can bet there would have been more topless women on motorcycles. Roll film! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.</p>
                <p>Why, those are the Grunka-Lunkas! They work here in the Slurm factory. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
                <p>Bender, you risked your life to save me! File not found. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Hey, guess what you're accessories to. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools.</p>
                <p>A sexy mistake. I'm Santa Claus! Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Look, last night was a mistake.</p>
                <p>Leela's gonna kill me. Ven ve voke up, ve had zese wodies. They're like sex, except I'm having them! I guess if you want children beaten, you have to do it yourself. Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and gagged.</p>
                <p>And then the battle's not so bad? I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Switzerland is small and neutral! We are more like Germany, ambitious and misunderstood! Ah, computer dating. It's like pimping, but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head."</p>
                <p>What kind of a father would I be if I said no? You mean while I'm sleeping in it? Negative, bossy meat creature! I guess because my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike. As though!</p>
                <p>Fry, we have a crate to deliver. Come, Comrade Bender! We must take to the streets! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it.</p>
                <p>Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file! Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.</p>

                <p>I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. I'm going to tell you something that I've never told anyone before.</p>
                <p>Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter. Keep your mind limber. I'm not the monster he wants me to be. So I'm neither man nor beast. I'm something new entirely. <strong> With my own set of rules.</strong> <em> I'm Dexter.</em> Boo.</p>

                <p>I've lived in darkness a long time. Over the years my eyes adjusted until the dark became my world and I could see. Only you could make those words cute. Somehow, I doubt that. You have a good heart, Dexter.</p>
