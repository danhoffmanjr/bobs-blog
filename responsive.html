                    <h2>Checkbox "Hack"</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    The Checkbox "Hack" is where you use a connected label and checkbox input and usually some other element you are trying to control, like the nested <span class="tag-name bold">&lt;ul&gt;</span> in the nav menu below.
                </p>
                <code>
                    <span class="brackets">&lt;</span><span class="tag-name">nav</span><span class="brackets">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="brackets">&lt;</span><span class="tag-name">input</span> <span class="attribute">type</span>=<span class="att-value">"checkbox"</span> <span class="attribute">id</span>=<span class="att-value">"mainNavButton"</span><span class="brackets">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="brackets">&lt;</span><span class="tag-name">label</span> <span class="attribute">for</span>=<span class="att-value">"mainNavButton"</span><span class="brackets">&gt;</span>MENU<span class="brackets">&lt;/</span><span class="tag-name">label</span><span class="brackets">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="brackets">&lt;</span><span class="tag-name">ul</span><span class="brackets">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="brackets">&lt;</span><span class="tag-name">li</span><span class="brackets">&gt;</span>menu link (anchor tag) here<span class="brackets">&lt;/</span><span class="tag-name">li</span><span class="brackets">&gt;</span><br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="brackets">&lt;</span><span class="tag-name">ul</span><span class="brackets">&gt;</span><br>
                    <span class="brackets">&lt;/</span><span class="tag-name">nav</span><span class="brackets">&gt;</span>
                </code>
                <p>
                    Then with CSS, you hide the checkbox entirely. This can be done by positioning it off the page with absolute positioning or setting its opacity to zero. But, even though the checkbox is hidden, clicking the <span class="tag-name bold">&lt;label&gt;</span> still toggles its value on and off. Then you can use the adjacent sibling combinator to style the <span class="tag-name bold">&lt;ul&gt;</span> differently based on the <span class="tag-name bold">:checked</span> state of the input.
                </p>
                <h3>Using the Tilda (~)</h3>
                <p>Also known as the adjacent sibling combinator, the tilda (~) is part of the secret to making this hack work.</p>
                <code>
                    <span class="selector">input[</span><span class="attribute">type</span>=<span class="att-value">"checkbox"</span><span class="selector">]:checked</span> ~ <span class="selector">ul</span> {<br>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="attribute">display</span>: <span class="att-value">block</span> <span class="tag-name">!important</span>;<br>
                    }
                </code>
                <p>This combinator allows you to style a subsequent adjacent element completely differently depending on the state of that checkbox, which you don't even see. Pretty cool!</p>

                <h3>Is this really a CSS hack?</h3>
                <p>If you’ve been writing CSS for at least a couple of years, then you’ve most certainly used a CSS hack. But if you’re relatively new to CSS, it’s possible you’ve heard the term but aren’t sure exactly what it means. This <a href="https://www.sitepoint.com/what-is-the-definition-of-a-css-hack/">site</a> can help you better understand CSS Hacks.</p>
                <P><strong>Hint:</strong> this <em><dfn title="Trick is probably a better term to use to describe this technique.">trick</dfn></em> falls outside of the technical definition of a hack.</P>

                    <h2>UI Design Patterns, with Psychology?</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    Moving beyond patterns for usability and into the realm of Persuasive Design Patterns, what role can psychology play in design to guide users to a desired behavior?
                </p>
                <h3>Persuasive Design Patterns</h3>
                <p>
                    Over time habits are formed as customers form associations sparking unprompted engagement. They move from needing external triggers like advertisements and other calls to action, to letting associations with internal triggers spark unprompted engagement on its own; to self-trigger. The hard part is getting from the need of external triggers to letting internal triggers and associations do their job. Looking into the patterns of psychology is the key. This is were Persuasive Design Patterns come in.
                </p>
                <p>Let's look at an example:</p>
                <h3>Cognition Patterns</h3>
                <p>Cognition is a pattern of psychological tendencies that cause the human brain to draw incorrect conclusions.</p>
                <p>Take the <strong>Status-Quo Bias Design Pattern</strong> for example. The behavior problem this solves is that we tend to accept the default option instead of comparing the actual benefit to the actual cost.</p>
                <p><strong>The Rationale:</strong> Simply stating what options are more popular is often enough to influence a decision that sticks. Simply pre-filling a form with default options is often enough to make people choose them. Alternative options that seem too cumbersome to comprehend will make people stick with the status quo.</p>
                <p><strong>The Solution:</strong> When the user has a number of options to choose from, you can help him or her on the way by framing one of the options as the default option. Let's say you run a subscription based web application with several plans, each with its own price and list of benefits. A popular plan is going to be dropped in favor of one with a higher price and better list of benefits, which leaves the users to either downgrade or upgrade; loosing old features or gaining new. Moving everybody to the new plan and framing it as being the same with new features positions the status quo reference point to the bigger plan, with the result that most people will “stay”.</p>
                <p><span class="tag-name">Facebook</span> utilized the status-quo bias in December 2009, when they changed their user privacy policy. They changed a user’s privacy settings into having a default setting which the user had to opt-out from. The complicated and non-transparent nature of the new policy kept users from changing them.</p>
                <p><span class="tag-name">Microsoft Azure</span> uses this pattern when creating a new web app, only in this instance, not changing the defaults can be very, very costly.</p>
            </section>
            <aside role="article-aside">
                <h3>Is it Ethical?</h3>
                <p>Ethics and UX should go hand in hand, but sometimes it’s not easy to decide what is right and what is wrong. UX experts use every arsenal at their disposal to make the user experience compelling. We use every scientific design heuristic known to man.</p>
                <p>Influencing people’s behavior for profit is not new. Marketers first used many persuasive behaviors in the mid-1930s when John B. Watson, an American psychologist, conducted psychological research in advertising. He concluded that marketing depended not on appealing to rational thought, but on appealing to emotions and stimulating desire for a product.</p>
                <p>So, isn’t it imperative that we ask, “Are we designing the ‘right’ thing?” And more importantly, what is the “right” thing? After all, it’s not always easy to decide what’s right. But as UX professionals we should decide soon. After all, who is responsible when UX goes wrong?</p>

                    <h2>Set up a VPN in 10 minutes for free</h2>
                </header>
                <p>
                    VPN stands for Virtual Private Network. It can be a useful tool for those that still believe that privacy (even digital privacy) is a fundamental human right.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 1: enable HTTPS Everywhere</h3>
                <p>
                    HTTPS works by encrypting traffic between destination websites and your device by using the secure TLS protocol. As of 2017, only about 10% of websites have enabled HTTPS, and even many of those websites haven’t properly configured their systems to disallow insecure non-HTTPS traffic (even though it’s free and easy to do using <strong>LetsEncrypt</strong>).
                </p>
                <p>
                    But even with HTTPS enabled, ISPs will still know — thanks to their role in actually connecting you to websites themselves — what websites you’re visiting, even if they don’t know what you’re doing there. And just knowing where you’re going — the “metadata” of your web activity — gives ISPs a lot of information they can sell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That’s where using a VPN comes in.
                </p>
                <h3>Step 2: Getting a VPN</h3>
                <p><strong>Browser-based VPNs:</strong> Most VPNs are services that cost money. But the first VPN option I’m going to tell you about is convenient and completely free.</p>
                <p><strong class="tag-name">Opera</strong> is a popular web browser that comes with some excellent privacy features, like a free built-in VPN and a free ad blocker (and as you may know, ads can spy on you).</p>
                <p>If you just want a secure way to browse the web without ISPs being able to easily snoop on you and sell your data, Opera is a great start. <strong class="tag-name">Brave</strong>, a new browser, is another good option.</p>
                <p>Note that these browsers will only anonymize the things you do within the browsers. Also, I’m obligated to point out that even though Opera’s parent company is European, it was recently purchased by a consortium of Chinese tech companies, and there is a non-zero risk that it could be compromised by the Chinese government.</p>
                <p><strong>VPN Services:</strong> The most common way people get VPNs is through a monthly service. There are a ton of these. Ultimately, you must trust the company running the VPN, because there’s no way to know what they’re doing with your data.</p>
                <p>There are many VPN services available. This <a href="https://thatoneprivacysite.net/vpn-comparison-chart/">site</a> will help you compare the different options.</p>
                <p>Some VPNs are improperly configured, and may leak personally identifying data. Once you buy a VPN, the best way to double check that it’s working properly is to visit <a href="http://www.ipleak.net">ipleak.net</a> while using the VPN.</p>
                <h3>How VPNs can protect you</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Virtual</strong> because you’re not creating a new physical connecting with your destination — your data is just traveling through existing wires between you and your destination.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Private</strong> because it encrypts your activity before sending it, then decrypts it at the destination.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>People have traditionally used VPNs as a way to get around websites that are blocked in their country (for example, Medium is blocked in Malaysia) or to watch movies that aren’t available in certain countries. But VPNs are extremely useful for privacy, too.</p>
                <p><strong>One last thing to note:</strong> Even though most users of VPNs are companies with remote employees, the NSA will still put you on a list if you purchased a VPN. So I recommend using something anonymous to do so, like a pre-loaded Visa card. (By the way, Bitcoin is not anonymous.)</p>

                <h3>Americans urgently need VPNs, thanks to Congress</h3>
                <p>Thanks to the US Senate's recent decision, ISPs can sell your entire web browsing history to literally anyone without your permission. The only rules that prevented this are all being repealed, and won’t be reinstated any time soon (it would take an act of Congress).</p>
                <p>According to the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/03/five-creepy-things-your-isp-could-do-if-congress-repeals-fccs-privacy-protections">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, there are at least five creepy things the FCC regulations would have made illegal. But thanks to the Senate, ISPs can now continue doing these things as much as they want.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sell your browsing history to basically any corporation or government that wants to buy it.</li>
                    <li>Hijack your searches and share them with third parties.</li>
                    <li>Monitor all your traffic by injecting their own malware-filled ads into the websites you visit.</li>
                    <li>Stuff undetectable, un-deletable tracking cookies into all of your non-encrypted traffic.</li>
                    <li>Pre-install software on phones that will monitor all traffic — even HTTPS traffic — before it gets encrypted. AT&amp;T, Sprint, and T-Mobile have already done this with some Android phones.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><blockquote>“Arguing that you don’t care about the right to privacy because you have nothing to hide is no different than saying you don’t care about free speech because you have nothing to say.” — Edward Snowden</blockquote></p>
